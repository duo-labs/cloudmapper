# This file is appended to as I find out about more vendors that have publicly
# referenced their AWS account IDs to create some sort of trust relationships.
#
# -- Parameterers
# name: Vendor name.
# source: URL that publicly mentions the account ID in association with this
#     vendor.
# type: Optional parameter, mostly used to reference `aws`
# accounts: Array of 12-digit AWS account IDs
#
# Note the `name` is referenced in ./web/style.json which then references an
# image file in ./web/icons/logos/ for these vendors to display in the 
# web-of-trust view.
#
# Some of these were found originally from https://github.com/dagrz/aws_pwn/blob/master/miscellanea/integrations.txt
